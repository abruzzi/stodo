update (23 Feb 2023)
======

It has been quite a while since my last update (around 13 years), and I'm still a happy developer - which is amazing.

- `compile` is changed to `implementation` in gradle
- `rhino` engine is deprecated, and `graalvm` is the replacement
- `java.awt` seems not a thing any more, and `swing` is kinda working

I made a few changes in both Java and JavaScript side, and it now working for most cases.
